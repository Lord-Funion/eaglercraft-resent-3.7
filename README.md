# Welcome to The Resent Launcher!
Here we (and by we I mean me and Nitwit) have 2 options and 2 options only.

## Legacy Build 
The legacy build is the version of Resent Client that were before the website got taken down, it contains lots of features and loads a bit quicker but lacks some of the newer ones (1.7 animations and cosmetics)

## 3.5 Build
This used to be the "development" build, but the bugs have been fixed soooooo ywah.

## 1.5 build?
im not doing it. And before you ask "oh but why not?", IM TOO LAZY AND 1.5 IS NO LONGER MAINSTREAM

## Credits
### 90% of the Work
Nitwit (hooman#1196) He coded everything from the client.)

### The launcher
Technix_ / Webbic (im probably on dc)


AND GUESS WHAT!?!?
# NITWIT NOTICED ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (yay!)
